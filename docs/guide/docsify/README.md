# Documentation Service

> The introduction intends to explain to the user what this documentation is about

The documentation service intends to guide the user to write simple and standardized documentation, facilitating user understanding and documentation maintenance.

For this the Documentation Service will use the [framework diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/) and will follow the four modes below:

?> The introduction must tell what the service does in a direct form. If it is necessary, you can put links to the main concepts of the theory, or use images.

!> But remember, this part is just the introduction, do not give many details about the solution here.


After reading the introduction, the users should know what the service does and should be able to decide if the service is the right tool to solve their problems.
